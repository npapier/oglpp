#summary Getting Started with glContext

= Overview =

*glContext* or how to add OpenGL capabilities to any user interface toolkits.

= Details =

The goal of the glContext library is to build a simple API which provides the OpenGL capabilities to any widget of any user interface toolkit.
It should be available on any operating system.

glContext API, inspired by [http://www.cairographics.org cairo], are available throw several C libraries.
The main library, called *glc*, contains the API to manage OpenGL context. The secondary library contains the bridge between a user interface toolkit and *glc*.
Available bridges :
 * *glc_gtk* for gtk
 * *glc_gtkmm* for gtkmm
 * wxWidgets (todo)
 * QT (todo)

*glContext* could be used on MS/Windows (X11 on GNU/Linux to come).
